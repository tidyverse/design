# User settable defaults {#def-user}

```{r, include = FALSE}
source("common.R")
```

## What's the pattern?

It's sometimes useful to give the user control over default values, so that they can set once per session or once for every session in their `.Rprofile`. To do so, use `getOption()` in the default value.

Note that this pattern should general only be used to control the side-effects of a function, not its compute value. The two primary uses are for controlling the apperance of output, particulary in `print()` methods, and for setting default values in generated templates. 

Related patterns:

* If a global option affects the results of the computation (not just its 
  side-effects), you have an example of Chapter \@ref(args-hidden).
